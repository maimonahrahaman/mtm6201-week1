            Hey there! I'm Maimonah, a level 2 IMD (Interactive Media Design) student. I am thrilled to share a little bit about myself with you. Being a part of the fascinating world of IMD, I've always been captivated by the power of creativity and technology. I'm passionate about crafting immersive digital experiences that engage and inspire people.

            Beyond my studies, I'm a music enthusiast. I enjoy immersing myself in different genres, from soothing melodies to energetic beats. Music has a way of transporting me to another realm and igniting my creativity. I also love attending live concerts and discovering new artists who can provide a fresh perspective on life.
